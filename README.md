## Introduction

> ***Globally***, as of **3:42pm CEST, 13 May 2021**, there have been **160,074,267 confirmed cases** of COVID-19, including **3,325,260 deaths**, reported to WHO. As of **12 May 2021**, a total of 1,264,164,553 vaccine doses have been administered.


This is the latest data from [WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/).

As the Covid-19 epidemic spreads around the world, the virus continues to evolve, which severely affecting people's lives around the world. According to UK [government figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51768274), there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died. However, the heart-breaking scenes not only happen in the UK. Coronavirus has caused many humanitarian crises around the world. For example, [India has descended into Covid-19 chaos] (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56977653) because of its poor healthcare infrastructure.  Coupled with the wave of [globalisation](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56864100), it is no longer possible for any country to stand alone. Therefore, even though the COVID has subsided in the UK, we cannot stop protecting ourselves.

However, [anti-lockdown](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/anti-lockdown-protesters-defy-restrictions-central-london-march-2021-04-24/) and [anti-mask](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/05/01/hundreds-of-anti-lockdown-anti-mask-protesters-take-to-the-streets-again-in-downtown-barrie.html) activities around the world have not ceased either. From this we can conclude that despite the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)'s insistence on 'Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people', many people are still not convinced of the need to wear masks and maintain social distance.

In order to control the Covid, all of us should work together, believe in science and should take the initiative and prevent the Covid. However, for different reasons, many people find it difficult to accept the scientific knowledge and are reluctant to comply with coronavirus prevention policies. This has greatly helped the spread of the coronavirus. So, how can we make people more aware of outbreaks around the world and comply with the policy through a fun website?

CovidSurvival is an online social platform. On our webpage one can see real-time coronavirus statistics from around the world. It is also possible to see people from other different parts of the world sharing their lives with the coronavirus. More participation, more points, more exposure. By seeing how people in other regions are living, we hope that users will gain a clearer understanding of the dangers of coronavirus and be proactive in keeping their social distance and protection.
