 ## What is ***CovidSurvival***

How to survival in this post COVID would?  
Check if you want to travel. There's travelling policy for each country  
Check if you fear of cases. There's real time statistics of each country  
Check if you feel alone. There's people around the world sharing and supporting each others  

## Introduction

> （提交作业前最后更新一下）***Globally**, as of **12:18pm CEST, 5 May 2021**, there have been **153,738,171 confirmed cases** of COVID-19, including **3,217,281 deaths**, reported to WHO. As of **3 May 2021**, a total of **1,047,825,481 vaccine doses** have been administered.

This is the latest data from [WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/).

> As the Covid-19 epidemic spreads around the world, the virus continues to evolve, which severely affecting people's lives around the world. According to UK [government figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51768274), there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died. However, the heart-breaking scenes not only happen in the UK. Coronavirus has caused many humanitarian crises around the world. Coupled with the wave of [globalisation](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56864100), it is no longer possible for any country to stand alone. Therefore, even though the COVID has subsided in the UK, we cannot stop protecting ourselves.

> However, [anti-lockdown](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/anti-lockdown-protesters-defy-restrictions-central-london-march-2021-04-24/) and [anti-mask](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/05/01/hundreds-of-anti-lockdown-anti-mask-protesters-take-to-the-streets-again-in-downtown-barrie.html) activities around the world have not ceased either. From this we can conclude that despite the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)'s insistence on 'Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people', many people are still not convinced of the need to wear masks and maintain social distance.

In order to control the Covid, all of us should work together, believe in science and should take the initiative and prevent the Covid. However, for different reasons, many people find it difficult to accept the scientific knowledge and are reluctant to comply with coronavirus prevention policies. This has greatly helped the spread of the coronavirus. So, how can we make people more aware of outbreaks around the world and comply with the policy through a fun website?

CovidSurvival is an online social platform. On our webpage one can see real-time coronavirus statistics from around the world. It is also possible to see people from other different parts of the world sharing their lives with the coronavirus. More participation, more points, more exposure. By seeing how people in other regions are living, we hope that users will gain a clearer understanding of the dangers of coronavirus and be proactive in keeping their social distance and protection.

## Conclusion

Considering that this was the first time we had applied software engineering development methods to a project, we were very careful in our communication. Firstly, we meet two or three times a week to ensure we can simulate a normal stand up meeting. Secondly, we use Asana to manage our tasks. For example, we use this software to assign tasks and to follow up on the progress of each person's tasks. These activities allow us to keep in close contact and communicate issues in a timely manner, thus enabling agile development.

By comparing the list of features (backlog) drawn up at the beginning of the project based on user requirements, I think we have completed our project according to plan. In the backlog, we have prioritised the features for the different iterations in order of priority. This helped us to iterate through the versions in order of importance, and ultimately to create a more complete prototype. According to our plan, all the basic functionality should have been implemented in iteration 2. However, at the time of submission, we had completed the third iteration, and the prototype was much more feature-rich and interesting than the previous version.

Coronavirus has forced us to choose to work remotely, but we have planned ahead for this. In order to ensure that we can keep in touch with each other during remote collaboration, we ensure that there are two or more ways of contacting each other. For example, excluding teams, members can communicate with each other via wechat, whatsapp, etc. In extreme cases we can also meet offline to deal with unforeseen situations, that is, to meet each other face-to-face by knowing each other's address. However, we still regret that we did not have the opportunity to have a real face-to-face stand up meeting.

> Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.

In terms of design, we need more usability testing to tweak the user interface and interaction story, and we can refer to more UI design methods to increase user stickiness. In terms of development, in addition to the features mentioned in the backlog for subsequent iterations, algorithms can be applied to our product. For example, the home page can be used to recommend content that may be of more interest to users based on the algorithm. In terms of evaluation, we can further deepen our evaluation tools from two perspectives. For example, code testing can be done using other open-source tools and inviting people not involved in development to black-box test the prototype. For user testing, we can use data collection techniques such as eye-movement technology to obtain statistical data for quantitative analysis.
