## Introduction

For our flexible and extensible project, we use Agile which is a set of best practices in software development based on Scrum, Extreme Programming and Lean. Besides, Agile also requires a different approach, which is adapted to incremental development and the particular strengths of agile methods.
We mainly use the Scrum approach which is a general Agile method but its focus is on managing iterative development rather than specific agile practices. There are three core phases in Scrum including making the outline planning, planning the series of sprint cycles and closure phase. More details about the sprint cycle information and so on can be acquired from Appendix 10.

The reason why we choose Scrum as our core method is that the clear process helps us to plan the whole work and to divide them into several stages. The project of CovidSurvival is broken down into a series of the manageable and understandable chunk so that it becomes much easier for our team to reach an agreement on the detail of the project requirement. Also, unstable requirements can never hold up the process. Through several stand-up meetings, the whole team can have visibility of everything which helps us to keep the same pace and share the information about the schedule and existing problem.

For example, as a project facing to the user all aroung the world, end user can easily participate in the whole developing process, which gives us a convenient channel to obtain the feedback, so that later increment can be successfully conducted based on end users’ evaluation. Besides, to make the project to be easy enough to use, the System user interfaces are developed using an interactive development system with pictures and a few animations in order to prove the end users’ engagement.

## Risk Management

| **Possible Risks**  | **Risk Type** | **Occurrence Possibility** | **Solutions**  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A member is ill or non-available circumstances | People    | Medium   | Dynamically adjust personnel tasks in terms of unforeseen  |
| Difficult to integrate all projects from sub-groups due to different configurations | Tools   | High | Unified development environment and commit code regularly for test |
| Computer crashed  | Tools    | Medium      | Use Github and store regularly   |
| Inefficient allocation of team work leads to low efficiency  | Organizational  | Low   | In early stage, task allocation should be in detail and task load should be well estimated. |
| Low quality code can result in needless test and re-code repeatedly | Design and Implementation | Medium   | Before committing code, one of member for sub-group need to review the code in advance. |
| The requirements have not been fully analyzed. | Requirements  | Medium   | In early stage, we need take sufficient time for requirement analysis, and when designing, any change for requirements should be discussed if it is necessary. |
