### DESKTOP UI WIREFRAME

Original prediction game and map wireframe design for desktop UI (up), and updated with forum wireframe design (down):

- Original prediction game and map wireframe
<div class="d-flex flex-justify-between">
<div class="p-5"><img src="Wire1a.png"width=45%></div>
<div class="p-5"><img src="Wire1b.png"width=45%></div>
</div>
------

- updated with forum wireframe

We picked a world map to attract users to click and search the current situation of other country, and decided a one page ui to simplify data and tasks and to avoid switching different functionalities in the other pages.

Because of ethical issue, we finally modified our product. We add new game system with socail interaction like forum and likes, and added more information not only about official unumbers of covid but also trending tags and hot words.

We want to make our product more friendly, after interviewed many users and collect their feedback, it’s necessary for us to add introduction and tutorial in the begining.

#### Interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems

Map is the key feature for our product so we choose destoop ui for this project. In the future, mobile version will be considered since it may encourage user to use forum and socail interaction frequently.

- User journey flow
  - Without authentication, the user could view government infomation, travel policy, news, ranking of users’ points, official covid statistics and trending words statistics by clicking map and switching to the other country.
  - With authentication, the user could collect points by post, like, reply in the forum or click map to check the data of other countries.
